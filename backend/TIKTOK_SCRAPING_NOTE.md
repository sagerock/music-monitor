# TikTok Scraping Status

## Current Issue
TikTok scraping is not working because:
1. Most reliable TikTok scrapers on Apify are paid actors (not included in free tier)
2. Free actors are unreliable or frequently broken due to TikTok's anti-scraping measures
3. TikTok actively blocks automated scraping more aggressively than Instagram/YouTube

## Options:

### Option 1: Use a Paid Apify Actor
- **Apify TikTok Scraper** (apify/tiktok-scraper) - $5/1000 profiles
- Requires upgrading Apify plan or paying per use
- Most reliable option

### Option 2: Use RapidAPI TikTok Endpoints
- Services like "TikTok Scraper" on RapidAPI
- ~$10-20/month for basic tier
- More reliable than free Apify actors

### Option 3: Manual Entry Only
- Users can add TikTok links but stats won't auto-update
- This is the current state

### Option 4: Custom Scraping Solution
- Build your own TikTok scraper
- Very challenging due to aggressive anti-bot measures
- Requires constant maintenance

## Recommendation
For now, TikTok links can be added but won't show follower counts automatically. Instagram and YouTube work great with the current setup.

If TikTok data becomes critical, consider:
1. Upgrading to a paid Apify plan
2. Using RapidAPI's TikTok endpoints
3. Finding a specific TikTok API service

## What's Working:
✅ Instagram scraping via Apify (free tier)
✅ YouTube data via API + Apify fallback
❌ TikTok scraping (requires paid solution)
