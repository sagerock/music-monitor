# üéµ Learning Path: From Berklee to Code

Welcome Indy! This learning path is designed specifically for you - combining your music business expertise from Berklee with practical coding skills for A&R technology.

## üéØ Your Journey Overview

**Goal**: Build coding skills while creating real A&R tools you can use in your career.

**Timeline**: 3-month progressive learning path

**Outcome**: Ability to build and customize A&R discovery tools

## üìö Month 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1: Environment & Git Basics
**Learning Goals:**
- [ ] Set up GitHub Codespaces
- [ ] Understand version control (git)
- [ ] Make your first pull request

**Your First PR: "Hello A&R World"**
```javascript
// Add your name to the team in frontend/src/components/header.tsx
const team = ['Dad', 'Indy'] // You are now part of the codebase!
```

**A&R Connection**: Version control is like tracking different mixes of a song - you can always go back to earlier versions.

---

### Week 2: React Components & Props
**Learning Goals:**
- [ ] Understand component structure
- [ ] Pass data with props
- [ ] Read existing components

**Project: Artist Card Enhancement**
```javascript
// Add a new field to display artist's label
<ArtistCard 
  name={artist.name}
  label={artist.label} // Your addition!
  momentum={artist.momentum}
/>
```

**A&R Connection**: Components are like modular parts of an A&R report - each section (artist bio, streaming stats, social metrics) is a separate component.

---

### Week 3: State & User Interaction
**Learning Goals:**
- [ ] Understand React state
- [ ] Handle user clicks
- [ ] Update UI dynamically

**Project: A&R Notes Feature**
```javascript
// Add ability to save notes about artists
const [notes, setNotes] = useState('');

const saveNote = () => {
  // Save A&R notes about this artist
  console.log('Saving A&R insight:', notes);
};
```

**A&R Connection**: State is like your mental model of an artist - it changes as you gather more information.

---

### Week 4: API Calls & Data
**Learning Goals:**
- [ ] Fetch data from APIs
- [ ] Display loading states
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully

**Project: Spotify Data Display**
```javascript
// Fetch and display additional Spotify metrics
const fetchArtistDetails = async (artistId) => {
  const data = await spotifyApi.getArtist(artistId);
  return data;
};
```

**A&R Connection**: APIs are like having assistants who gather specific information for you - Spotify API gets streaming data, social APIs get engagement metrics.

## üöÄ Month 2: Building Features (Weeks 5-8)

### Week 5: Full Feature Development
**Project: Genre Deep-Dive Dashboard**
- Create a new page for genre analysis
- Use your Berklee knowledge of sub-genres
- Display artists grouped by micro-genres

**Skills**: Routing, data filtering, UI design

---

### Week 6: Database Integration
**Project: Artist Watchlist with Notes**
- Save personal notes to database
- Retrieve and display saved insights
- Add timestamp tracking

**Skills**: Prisma ORM, database queries, CRUD operations

---

### Week 7: Real-time Updates
**Project: Momentum Alerts**
- Create notification system for momentum changes
- Set custom thresholds
- Real-time dashboard updates

**Skills**: WebSockets, state management, notifications

---

### Week 8: Data Visualization
**Project: A&R Analytics Dashboard**
- Chart momentum trends
- Genre distribution graphs
- Geographic heat maps

**Skills**: Recharts, data transformation, visual design

## üé∏ Month 3: Advanced & Independent (Weeks 9-12)

### Week 9-10: Backend Development
**Project: Custom Momentum Algorithm**
- Implement your own momentum calculation
- Add weight to different signals
- A/B test against current algorithm

**Skills**: Node.js, API design, algorithm implementation

---

### Week 11-12: Capstone Project
**Your Choice - Pick One:**

1. **Label Tracker System**
   - Track artist label changes
   - Identify label signing patterns
   - Predict next signings

2. **Tour Data Integration**
   - Pull tour dates from APIs
   - Correlate touring with momentum
   - Geographic market analysis

3. **Playlist Analyzer**
   - Track playlist additions/removals
   - Identify playlist momentum patterns
   - Curator relationship mapping

## üõ†Ô∏è Coding Patterns to Master

### Pattern 1: Component Composition
```javascript
// Small, reusable components
<ArtistProfile>
  <ArtistHeader />
  <ArtistStats />
  <ARNotes /> // Your custom addition
</ArtistProfile>
```

### Pattern 2: Data Fetching
```javascript
// Standard pattern for API calls
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  fetchData().then(setData).finally(() => setLoading(false));
}, []);
```

### Pattern 3: Event Handling
```javascript
// User interactions
const handleSaveToWatchlist = (artistId) => {
  // Your A&R decision captured in code
  addToWatchlist(artistId);
  trackARActivity('watchlist_add', artistId);
};
```
