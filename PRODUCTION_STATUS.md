# Production Status - RESOLVED ✅

## Latest Deployment Status (Sequential Query Fix)

### ✅ FIXED: Connection Pool Exhaustion
The rating panel not updating issue has been resolved by changing from parallel to sequential database queries.

### Test Results:
- ✅ Backend Health: Working
- ✅ Database Connection: Working  
- ✅ Ratings Endpoint: **FIXED** (was 500 error)
- ✅ Comments Endpoint: **FIXED** (was timeout error)
- ✅ Socials Endpoint: Working
- ✅ YouTube Stats: Working with all URL formats

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. Sequential Query Execution
Changed from parallel `Promise.all()` to sequential `await` in:
- `/backend/src/api/ratings.ts` - Lines 24-51
- `/backend/src/api/comments.ts` - Lines 25-54

**Before (caused pool exhaustion):**
```javascript
const [ratings, total, stats] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.rating.findMany(...),
  prisma.rating.count(...),
  prisma.rating.aggregate(...)
]);
```

**After (prevents exhaustion):**
```javascript
const ratings = await prisma.rating.findMany(...);
const total = await prisma.rating.count(...);
const stats = await prisma.rating.aggregate(...);
```

### 2. Database Configuration
Using Supabase Pro with connection pooling:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?connect_timeout=30&pool_timeout=30
```

## Current Production URLs:
- Backend: https://music-monitor.onrender.com
- Frontend: Check Vercel dashboard for correct URL

## Known Limitations:
1. **Instagram Scraping**: Requires paid Render tier for Docker/headless browser support
2. **Performance**: Sequential queries are slightly slower but more stable

## Monitoring:
Run `./test-production.sh` to verify all endpoints are working correctly.

## Next Steps:
1. Monitor rating panel in production UI
2. Verify users can add/update ratings without errors
3. Consider upgrading Render if Instagram scraping is needed
