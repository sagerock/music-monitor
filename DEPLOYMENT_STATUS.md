# Deployment Status Report

## Current Issues

### 1. ‚úÖ YouTube Stats - FIXED
- **Issue**: YouTube URLs without @ prefix weren't being recognized
- **Solution**: Added support for plain username URLs and search functionality
- **Status**: Working - successfully fetches subscriber counts

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Instagram Stats - LIMITED 
- **Issue**: Instagram scraping requires headless browser (Playwright)
- **Limitation**: Render's free tier doesn't support running headless browsers
- **Solution Options**:
  1. Upgrade to paid Render plan that supports Docker
  2. Use a different service for Instagram scraping (e.g., RapidAPI)
  3. Manual entry only (current state)

### 3. üî¥ Database Connection on Production - CRITICAL
- **Issue**: Backend on Render can't connect to Supabase database
- **Error**: `Can't reach database server at aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432`
- **Endpoints Affected**:
  - `/api/ratings/artist/*` - 500 error
  - `/api/socials/artist/*` - 500 error  
  - Instagram/YouTube stats updates fail silently

## Required Actions on Render Dashboard

### Fix Database Connection (URGENT)

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Select your `music-monitor` service
3. Go to Environment tab
4. Verify/Update `DATABASE_URL`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.mpskjkezcifsameyfxzz:wzf5ayw5PWZ2pkb*kzd@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
   ```
   
   **IMPORTANT**: 
   - Use port `5432` (not 6543)
   - The password contains a `*` character - ensure it's not being escaped incorrectly
   - Consider encoding the password if special characters cause issues

5. Also verify these are set:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://mpskjkezcifsameyfxzz.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[your service role key]
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

6. Click "Save Changes" and wait for redeploy

## Test After Fixing

```bash
# Test database connection
curl "https://music-monitor.onrender.com/api/ratings/artist/0NB5HROxc8dDBXpkIi1v3d?page=1&limit=20"

# Should return success with data, not 500 error
```

## Local Development Works Because

- Local backend connects directly to Supabase successfully
- YouTube stats work after fix
- All features functional except Instagram scraping (browser limitation)

## Production Issues Summary

1. **Database connection failing** - Environment variable issue on Render
2. **Instagram scraping** - Platform limitation (needs paid tier)
3. **YouTube stats** - Fixed and working ‚úÖ
